# Job Board Platform with Graph ADT

## Problem Description

High levels of unemployment in South Africa are a persistent socio-economic challenge. Despite government efforts to create jobs and stimulate economic growth, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high, particularly among young people and those without formal qualifications.

To address this problem, this project proposes creating a job board platform that connects job seekers with companies. The platform will utilize the Graph ADT (Abstract Data Type) to represent the relationships between job seekers, companies, and job postings. Graph algorithms will be employed to match job seekers with relevant job postings based on their qualifications and preferences.

## Objects and Attributes in the Nodes

The following objects and their attributes will be contained in the nodes:

### Job Seeker Node:

- ID: unique identifier for the job seeker
- Name: name of the job seeker
- Contact Information: email address, phone number, etc.
- Location: city, province, etc.
- Qualifications: education level, work experience, skills, etc.
- Work Preferences: job title, industry, work schedule, etc.

### Company Node:

- ID: unique identifier for the company
- Name: name of the company
- Contact Information: email address, phone number, etc.
- Location: city, province, etc.
- Industry: type of business, e.g. finance, healthcare, etc.
- Company Size: number of employees, revenue, etc.
- Hiring Preferences: job titles, qualifications, etc.

### Job Posting Node:

- ID: unique identifier for the job posting
- Title: title of the job posting
- Description: a brief description of the job responsibilities and requirements
- Location: city, province, etc.
- Qualifications: education level, work experience, skills, etc.
- Salary: salary range, hourly rate, etc.
- Application Deadline: the date by which applications must be submitted

## Role of Edges and their Attributes

The edges in the graph will store additional information and play a crucial role in the solution. The following are the edge types and their attributes:

### Job Application Edge:

- Source Node: job seeker node
- Destination Node: job posting node
- Attributes: date of application, status of the application (e.g., pending, accepted, rejected), resume or cover letter (optional)

This edge represents a job seeker's application for a specific job posting. It helps track the job seeker's application history, status, and any attached documents.

### Interview Edge:

- Source Node: job seeker node
- Destination Node: company node
- Attributes: date of interview, type of interview (e.g., phone, in-person), interviewer's name, interview notes (optional)

This edge represents an interview between a job seeker and a company. It tracks interview details such as the date, type, interviewer's name, and any notes for evaluation purposes.

### Job Offer Edge:

- Source Node: company node
- Destination Node: job seeker node
- Attributes: date of the offer, salary or hourly rate, benefits package, start date

This edge represents a job offer made by a company to a job seeker. It captures details such as the date of the offer, salary, benefits, and the agreed-upon start date.

## Algorithms and Complexity

Graph algorithms will be employed to match job seekers with job postings based on their qualifications and preferences. Algorithms such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm, or A* algorithm can be utilized.

By using graph algorithms, the job board platform can efficiently and effectively match job seekers with job postings that fit their qualifications and preferences. The time complexity of the graph algorithms used will depend on the specific algorithm implemented and the size and complexity of the graph. Generally, graph algorithms have a time complexity of O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph and E is the number of edges.

## Project Justification

Using a graph data structure to solve the problem of job matching is beneficial for several reasons:

1. Efficient Searching: Representing job seekers, companies, and job postings as nodes in a graph allows for efficient searching and matching algorithms to be applied, enabling quick and effective connections between job seekers and companies.

2. Handling Complex Relationships: The graph data structure can handle complex relationships and dependencies between job seekers, companies, and job postings, allowing for more accurate and personalized job matching based on qualifications, preferences, and requirements.

3. Precise Job Matching: By considering multiple factors and utilizing graph algorithms, the job board platform can provide more precise and personalized job recommendations and matches, leading to increased successful job placements and reduced unemployment rates.

4. Flexibility and Scalability: The graph data structure provides flexibility and scalability, allowing the platform to handle a growing number of job seekers, companies, and job postings while maintaining efficient matching capabilities.

By leveraging the power of graph algorithms and the flexibility of a graph data structure, this job board platform aims to address unemployment challenges in South Africa and stimulate economic growth.

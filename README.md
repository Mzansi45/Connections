# Connections

Connections is a job board platform developed as a mini project for the University of Johannesburg. The project aims to test the understanding of graphs and their application in connecting companies, job seekers, and job postings.

## Problem Statement

High levels of unemployment and the challenge of finding suitable candidates for job openings are persistent issues. The Connections project addresses these challenges by leveraging a graph data structure and graph algorithms to connect job seekers with relevant job postings based on their skills and qualifications.

## Core Features

Connections offers the following core features:

- **Company Profiles**: Companies can create profiles and provide information such as company name, contact details, industry, and hiring preferences.

- **Job Postings**: Companies can post job openings, specifying job titles, descriptions, required qualifications, location, and application deadlines.

- **Job Seeker Profiles**: Job seekers can create profiles and include details such as their skills, qualifications, work experience, and job preferences.

- **Job Matching**: The platform uses a graph data structure to connect job seekers, job postings, and companies. Job seekers with matching skills and qualifications are connected to relevant job postings, and the company that posted the job is also linked to it.

- **Application Management**: Job seekers can apply for jobs they are interested in, creating an edge between the company and the job seeker. The platform keeps track of application status and relevant details.

- **Graph ADT**: The project utilizes a graph abstract data type (ADT) to represent and store the connections between companies, job seekers, and job postings.

- **Graph Algorithms**: Graph algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS), are implemented to efficiently traverse the graph and find suitable matches based on skills, qualifications, and other preferences.

## Technologies Used

The Connections project is built using the following technologies:

- **Programming Language**: Java

- **Graph ADT**: Custom implementation or a graph library (e.g., JGraphT, Jung, or your own implementation)

- **User Interface**: JavaFX for building the graphical user interface (GUI)

## Getting Started

To get started with Connections, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [git@github.com:Mzansi45/Connections.git]`
